## What I've acomplised

1. **Astro instalation**: Firstly, I've created a new Astro project and also linked it to my online dev accounts.

2. **Pages making**: Then I learnt how to make pages creating new '.astro' files and fitting them on the 'src/pages' folder.

3. **Post making**: This is my first post! Now I have Astro pages and posts on Markdown!

## Next steps

I will finish this Astro tutorial, and then I'll keep adding more posts.
