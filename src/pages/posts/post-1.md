# My first post on the blog

Uploaded in: 18/07/25

Welcome to my Astro blog! Here I will share my learning route meanwhile I build this new website.

**Notice!!**
This is more like a Logbook than a useful blog. But if you are interested on the same tutorial and you are wondering where to find it, you can [**click here**](https://docs.astro.build/es/tutorial/0-introduction/) to find it!

## What I've acomplised

1. **Astro instalation**: Firstly, I've created a new Astro project and also linked it to my online dev accounts.

2. **Pages making**: Then I learnt how to make pages creating new '.astro' files and fitting them on the 'src/pages' folder.

3. **Post making**: This is my first post! Now I have Astro pages and posts on Markdown!

## Next steps

I will finish this Astro tutorial, and then I'll keep adding more posts.
