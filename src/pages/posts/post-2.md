# My second post on the blog

Uploaded in: 18/07/25

**Notice!!**
This is more like a Logbook than a useful blog. But if you are interested on the same tutorial and you are wondering where to find it, you can [**click here**](https://docs.astro.build/es/tutorial/0-introduction/) to find it!

## What else I've done

Today I also learned how to add a link on a MarkDown file! They teach it on W3 Schools, you can access to the info [**here**](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-links/).

It's so easy!
