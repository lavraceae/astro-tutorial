## What I've done today

I've learned how a dynamic routing works. But I don't know well how to make general functions, just a slightly idea.

-The function 'getStatic()' turns Markdown tags into pages identifying them at the 'params'.
-You can also add 'props' to add relevant information to the function in order to work according to the situation.
